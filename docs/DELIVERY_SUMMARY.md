## 📝 Notes and Recommendations

### Important Considerations:

1. **Java Version**: Project requires Java 21, but environment has Java 17
   - Either upgrade to Java 21
   - Or modify pom.xml to use Java 17

2. **Educational Project**: This is for learning purposes
   - Do NOT use with real Bitcoin (mainnet) without security audit
   - Use testnet or regtest for development
   - Professional audit required before production use

3. **Security First**: 
   - All security requirements are documented
   - Follow security best practices
   - Never log sensitive information

4. **Incremental Development**:
   - Follow phases in order
   - Test after each phase
   - Don't skip testing

5. **Documentation**: 
   - Update README as you implement
   - Document API with OpenAPI
   - Keep security guide current
